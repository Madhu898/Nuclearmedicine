 Abstract: 
Early detection of metastatic involvement of lymph nodes is one of the greatest difficulties faced by the physicians. In the last few centuries, 
the lymphatic system has become an important field of interest in oncology. The lymphatic system functions in two opposing ways in cancer: defence
against circulating tumour cells, and, on the other hand, a route for metastasis and a site of tumour growth when the defence mechanism fails. 
The significant impact of lymphatic dissemination on the staging, treatment, and outcome of solid cancers has stimulated investiga¬tions aimed 
at gaining more insight into several aspects of the lymphatic system. Its application in oncology has evolved in the last 50 years fostered by 
the recognition of the relationship of lymph node metastases to prognosis in several types of malignant tumours. Lymphatic mapping also offers 
the opportunity for repetitive studies undertaken for evaluation of the patient during follow-up, thereby offering early evidence of recurrence 
of the disease. More recent and wide¬spread applications of lymphoscintigraphy form the basis for biopsy of the sentinel lymph node in patients 
with solid cancers. This article reviews the applications of lymphoscintigraphy (Lymphoscintigraphy is a special type of nuclear medicine imaging 
that provides special pictures of the lymphatic system, which transports fluid throughout your immune system)in the current diverse oncologic clinical 
indications for the assessment of secondary lymphedema related to oncologic treatments and sentinel lymph node lymphatic mapping.
